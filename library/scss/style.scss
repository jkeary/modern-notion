Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

/*********************
IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
our mixins, functions, and variables that we'll be using across
the whole project.
*********************/

// bootstrap partials
@import "partials/bootstrap/variables";
@import "partials/bootstrap/mixins";
@import "partials/bootstrap/grid";
@import "partials/bootstrap/component-animations";
@import "partials/bootstrap/modals";
@import "partials/bootstrap/utilities";
@import "partials/bootstrap/responsive-utilities";

// vendor partials
@import "partials/vendor/jquery.bxslider.scss";

// normalize: http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
@import "partials/normalize";


// Modern Notion Partials
@import "partials/variables";
@import "partials/mixins";
@import "partials/icon_font";
@import "partials/typography";
@import "partials/functions";
@import "partials/custom";


/*********************
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
*********************/
@media print {

	// styles in print.scss
	@import "partials/print";

}
